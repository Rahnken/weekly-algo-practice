/**
 * Prompt: Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". 
 Extension: Modify the function to take two additional parameters fizzNumber and buzzNumber to generalize the FizzBuzz logic to any two numbers.
